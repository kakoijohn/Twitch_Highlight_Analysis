Twitch Highlight Analysis

Twitch clip bot for making highlight reels

** Download twitch-chatlog with npm first. Follow these instructions: https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitch-chatlog **

** Instead of twitch-chatlog, I am using Twitch-Chat-Downloader (tcd) now. It gives me timestamps in a better format
and seems to be better at doing its job. **
